# Auckland Air Quality

The [R shiny application](https://szmsu2011.shinyapps.io/akl-air-quality) is the final deliverable for an [Honours Project in Statistics](https://www.calendar.auckland.ac.nz/en/courses/faculty-of-science/statistics.html) from the University of Auckland.

The web application attempts to approach the visualisation of air quality data in the Greater Auckland region (NZ) from a calendar-structured temporal perspective.

## Data Source

The data provided for the application was from the Air Quality Research and Evaluation Unit of the [Auckland Council](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz).

For the raw data, see [szmsu2011/hons-dissertation](https://github.com/szmsu2011/hons-dissertation).
